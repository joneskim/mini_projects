# Hashtable
In this micro-project on data structure implementation i learned about hashfunctions and how to implement a basic hashmap. This was inspired by what we learned in class about hashmaps and a homework problem. I also implemented it in C++ to get better at C++ syntax and development.

What tools and techniques did i use?
- Standard template library (STL) -> std::vector, std::pair, std::string

- Hash Function -> this is a very basic hash function

- Class and Object-oriented programming
Defined a basic hashtable class with private and public members and did encapsulation of data and methods within the class.

- Iterators and algorithms
Used iterators to traverse through std::vector 

- Pairs
std::pair<elem1, elem2>... calling pair.first gets the first element of the pair and pair.second gets the second element of the pair. This is basically a 2 element tuple if you thikn about it.
